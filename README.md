# IMT542_I4

This file shows 3 examples for different information structures with different access technologies. 
I write simple python functions to access each one and print out a sample of the information.

This file can be directly downloaded and run, with limited effort to set up environment. 
If you are using Google Colab, no changed will need to make. Otherwise, please ignore the "from google.colab import files" line.
